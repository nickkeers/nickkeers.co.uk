I'm a software developer currently residing in the North West of the UK. Professionally i'm interested in building observable software / observability in general, functional programming, improving development practices, optimising CI/CD workflows and removing toil in the development process, especially with automated testing. I'm currently tackling the all of the above in a Lead Developer role in the Public Sector - needless to say, this blog does not represent the views of my employer and are my own thoughts / opinions only.

Not so professionally I've been learning to play piano for a couple of years, playing video games and have a big love for reading / listening to books.
